# Nand2Tetris

Nand2Tetris is a course provided by Professors Shimon Schocken and Noam Nisan in which the student builds a 16-bit computer from the ground up.  
Part 1 of the course focuses on hardware, and in Part 2 you implement the software.

## Project 1

Project 1 involved creating 15 basic chips, including the elementary logic gates, and some (de)multiplexors. 

## Project 2

In Project 2, I built the ALU, after building half, full and 16 bit adders, as well as an incrementer.

## Project 3

In Project 3, focusing on sequential logic, I built a single bit register from elementary data flip flops, and expanded that up to RAM with 16K 16-bit registers. I also implemented a Program Counter out of DMux, a Register and an Incrementer.
